5 May 2024.

This is a result of my final project of OOVP Subject. This subject was on my 2nd semester of my college years.

The Project itself is named as Cinema just as it mainly purposed where in this project, user need to login via their username and password. 
In this project, user can add a movie, edit a movie, delete a movie, buying/booking ticket, and pay/cancel the unpaid tickets. All of it are stored in mysql database.
By far, the implementation of OOP in this project are the usage of class and object, inheritance, encapsulation, and  polymorphism.
